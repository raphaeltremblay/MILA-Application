# MILA-Application
Different code files I have written to demonstrate my coding skills.

The Word document "Report 468 Raphael [...]" explains the theory and reasoning behind the MATLAB codes "MyModelToRun.m" which uses te fonction "MyModelFx.m" and "SimpleSimulation.m" which uses the function "MyModelFx2.m".
The code in these 4 MATLAB files are all commented to facilitate understanding.

The files "Game.java" and "Configuration.java" create  game using the software Java. All work is commented
